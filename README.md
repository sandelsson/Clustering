This project consists of 2 different python scripts.

The jaccard distance is used to perform hierarchical clustering for my dataset. Hierarchical clustering is performed to find out the optimal number of K for further clustering, as well as validating the data.

The k-medoids clustering is done to perform final clustering and distinquishin different features from each cluster.
